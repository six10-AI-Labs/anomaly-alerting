# config.py
# Single source of truth for all configurable parameters.
# No values should be hardcoded anywhere else in the pipeline — import from here.
# All thresholds are starting points. Tune after launch based on real alert volume.

# =============================================================================
# QUICK TUNING GUIDE — read this first
# =============================================================================
#
# Getting too many alerts?
#   1. Raise STD_DEV_THRESHOLDS values (higher number = harder to trigger)
#   2. Raise ABSOLUTE_THRESHOLDS floors (e.g. return_rate warning: 0.035 → 0.05)
#   3. Set SUPPRESS_LESS_THAN_SINGLE = True  (removes <$250K ASINs from email)
#   4. Set SUPPRESS_WATCH_ALERTS = True      (removes Watch severity from email)
#
# Getting too few alerts (missing real problems)?
#   1. Lower STD_DEV_THRESHOLDS values (lower number = easier to trigger)
#   2. Lower ABSOLUTE_THRESHOLDS floors
#
# Want to tune a specific metric?
#   → Find it in STD_DEV_THRESHOLDS (rolling) and YOY_THRESHOLDS (year-over-year)
#   → Change the watch / warning / critical number for that metric only
#
# Want to validate changes before applying?
#   → Run: python backtest.py
#   → This shows alert counts per day across all historical data without sending any email
#
# After tuning, re-run backtest and aim for 5–15 Criticals/day.

# BASELINE CONFIGURATION
# =============================================================================
# The system uses TWO baselines simultaneously. An alert fires if EITHER triggers.
# Each alert clearly states which baseline flagged it so the team knows the context.

# --- Short-term rolling window (catches sudden recent changes) ---
# Plain English: "Compare today against the average of the last N days"
# 14 days catches sudden drops/spikes quickly. 30 days would smooth too much.
ROLLING_WINDOW_DAYS = 14

# Minimum days of data before rolling baseline is considered meaningful.
# Avoids false alerts in the first week of a new product's history.
ROLLING_MIN_PERIODS = 7

# --- Year-over-Year window (catches seasonal underperformance) ---
# Plain English: "Compare today against the same week last year"
# Uses a 7-day average (3 days before + same day + 3 days after) from last year
# to smooth out daily noise. Solves the seasonal ramp-up false alert problem.
YOY_WINDOW_DAYS = 7          # Number of days around the same date last year to average
MIN_HISTORY_DAYS_FOR_YOY = 365  # ASIN needs 12+ months of data to use YoY baseline
                                 # New SKUs fall back to rolling window only

#   watch    ≈ metric moved ~1.5x its typical daily variation — worth noting
#   warning  ≈ metric moved ~2x its typical daily variation — investigate soon
#   critical ≈ metric moved ~3x its typical daily variation — act today
#
# ACoS/TACoS have higher bands because ad metrics fluctuate more day-to-day.
# DO NOT lock these in — validate against historical data after launch.
